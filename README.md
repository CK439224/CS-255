•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
     o	Our client was DriverPass, and the owner wanted to create a system to take advantage of a void in the market when it comes to training students for their driving test. The vision of the system would be that the student would be able to create an account with their website then have three different package options to choose from. One the student chooses and pays for a packaged they would have the ability to register for classes, driving time with an instructor, and take online quizzes to prepare for the driving test. We outlined the different actors that would be involved in the system, the actions that would be taken within the system, and requirements that would need to be met. 

•	What did you do particularly well?
     o	I think I did pretty good on the business requirements document. It was pretty straight forward and I was easily able to work through it. 

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
     o	If I were to change one part of my work it would be my diagrams that were part of my system design document. I feel I could have added more information to make the diagram easier to understand and I also feel as though I left some key elements out of the diagrams. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
     o	I first took the information from the interview with the owner of the company to get a baseline of what the system needed to do. After this I looked at each user type for the system and tried to view the system from their point of view. For example, the student would have more actionable items from their access than the instructor would, so the students view on the website would need to be organized in a way that the student could easily navigate they system. It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing because they are ultimately the ones that you want to make happy. If a system is hard to understand and learn, this would turn user’s away from the product. 

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
     o	When designing software, I take a systematic approach. A big part of this is reviewing all documents that have information pertaining to what the system should do and look like. I take notes on every item that needs to be include and ensure that these needs are met. I make sure I have a clear understanding of what is wanted and if there is anything that I’m not sure on, I ask questions to clear them up. Then I break the project up into more manageable parts.
